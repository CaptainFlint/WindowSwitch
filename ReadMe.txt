The program performs quick switching between the last two active windows (like
single Alt+Tab) when a designated shortcut is pressed.

It is intended to run along with mouse software which allows to map mouse
buttons to keypresses, so that one could switch from one window to another using
one of the mouse buttons. A nonexistent key is recommended, so that no real
keyboard shortcut is taken from you. At the moment, F13 hotkey is used.
